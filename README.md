# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis  

## 🧠 Project Objective

To understand if marketing spend is truly driving revenue—or is the budget just burning without results?

In this project, I analyzed digital campaign data to uncover whether marketing efforts were delivering **actual returns**. The goal was to answer one core question every marketing team should ask:  
> **"Are we making money from our campaigns—or just spending it?"*

# Dataset Used

## 🔍 Methodology

I used **Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)** as the central performance metric to evaluate the effectiveness of different digital channels.
