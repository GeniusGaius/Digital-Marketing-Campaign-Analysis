## 🎯 Objective
Every dollar spent on marketing should earn its keep. This project answers the question **every CMO wants to know**:

> **“Which digital channels are driving profit—and which are wasting budget?”**

## 🧩 Business Scenario
You're a marketing exec reviewing Q4 campaign spend. You’ve allocated $31M across multiple channels: influencers, ads, email, social media. Revenue is in—but was it worth it?

My job was to **analyze the data and deliver clear, actionable recommendations** based on Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI).

- **DAX Measures** – ROMI, CPC, Orders by Channel, etc.

- **Business Insight Framing** – for stakeholder presentation  

## 📈 Key Findings

### 💡 What’s Driving ROI?
