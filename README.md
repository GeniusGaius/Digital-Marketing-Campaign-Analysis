# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis  

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To understand if marketing spend is truly driving revenueâ€”or is the budget just burning without results?

In this project, I analyzed digital campaign data to uncover whether marketing efforts were delivering **actual returns**. The goal was to answer one core question every marketing team should ask:  
> **"Are we making money from our campaignsâ€”or just spending it?"*

# Dataset Used
-<a href="https://github.com/GeniusGaius/Digital-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis/blob/main/Marketing.csv">Digital Marketing Dataset</a>

## Methodology
I used **Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)** as the central performance metric to evaluate the effectiveness of different digital channels.

## Tools & Skills Applied
- **Power BI** for data modeling and dashboard development  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
- **Calculated Measures (e.g., ROMI)**  
- **Interactive Visualizations**

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**
- Marketing Spend  
- Revenue Generated  
- Gross Profit  
- Total Leads  
- Cost Per Click (CPC)

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights:
### What Worked?
- **YouTube Influencers** outperformed every other channel with:
  - **$15M ROMI**
  - **1,914 orders**
 
- Overall, the campaign was profitable:
  - **$31M** spent  
  - **$43M** revenue  
  - **$12.3M** in gross profit  

### What Underperformed?
- **Facebook Retargeting**:
  - $1M ROMI with just 108 orders

- **Search Ads**:
  - ROMI at a low **8.6%**
 ### Timing Trends
- **Mid-month spikes** in orders  
- **Weekdays** slightly outperform weekends  


## Recommendation

- **Scale YouTube Influencer spend** for better ROI  
- **Cut back on Facebook Retargeting and Search Ads**  
- **Time campaigns around mid-month** to ride order peaks


## Summary

This project showcases how **data storytelling** and **clear ROI metrics** can drive marketing decisions. It also demonstrates my ability to derive actionable insights from complex campaign data using Power BI.
