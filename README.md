# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis  

## 🧠 Project Objective

To understand if marketing spend truly driving revenue—or is the budget just burning wihtout results?

In this project, I analyzed digital campaign data to uncover whether marketing efforts were delivering **actual returns**. The goal was to answer one core question every marketing team should ask:  
> **"Are we making money from our campaigns—or just spending it?"*
