# Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis  

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To understand if marketing spend is truly driving revenueâ€”or is the budget just burning without results?

In this project, I analyzed digital campaign data to uncover whether marketing efforts were delivering **actual returns**. The goal was to answer one core question every marketing team should ask:  
> **"Are we making money from our campaignsâ€”or just spending it?"*
